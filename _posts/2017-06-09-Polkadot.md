    * **Polkadot Core Properties**

        * **Extensibility / Flexible / Modularity**
            * Polkadot is system designed to allow differently
            designed parts to be introduced at later stages
            (i.e. different future Consensus Architectures)
            * Polkadot Protocol updatable with
            first class citizens the outcomes of discovering
            more interesting, performant and
            effective means of forming Consensus that achieve
            solutions we want blockchain to deliver

        * **Scalability**
            * Scalability over next 10 years
            * **Parachains** (Parallelised Chains) whereby
             Parallelising transactions (run multiple chains
            in parallel) across the network

        * **Heteregenality**
            * Polkadot allows each part blockchain
            that is running in parallel to be fundamentally
            differently kind of design (i.e. some like Bitcoin,
            some like Ethereum, etc)
            * Homogenous Shards (problem space i.e. db)
            are split up into equal bits from same cloth

    * **Polkadot Services** Provided (to its Community of Constituants/Users)

        * **Pooled Security** (Free)
            * Checks and guarantees Validity of transactions in your
            Parachain against **Consensus Protocol Rules (Rules)**
            equally secure for all
            Constituant member chains of Polkadot
            Community implementing the **Parachain**
            (under the Polkadot Protocol)
                * **Rules**
                    * Bitcoin (original blockchain, a currency)
                        * Removing and increasing value of
                        equal and opposite amount script
                    * Ethereum
                        * Turing Complete scripting language
            * Polkadot allows arbitrary **Rules**
            decidable at a later time, with different **Rules**
            for different parts of the system of **Parachains**

        * **Trust-free Transactions/Interactions Relaying** (Free)
            * Interactive chains leveraging Parallelism
            so Constituent Chains may send transactions to
            each other (instead of many isolated chains having
            to go through a Decentralised Exchange (DEX)
            or Intermediary)

    * **Polkadot Functionality** (how it works)

        * **Relay-Chain**
            * Connected to all Parachains and **shuffles**
            transactions around between them
            * Relays transactions at top-level by coordinating
            Consensus and transaction delivery between
            Constituents
            * Facilitates **Finalisation** of transactions
            since cannot shuffle messages from transactions onto other
            Parachains unless know the source transaction
            (comprising the message) is definately **Final**
            (otherwise must revert an entire dependency
            graph)
                * Loosely ties the Finality together by
                using **Validation Function**
                    * **Finality** (i.e. where if two mutually
                   exclusive and equally valid transactions to pay out,
                   only want one to go through
            * Fees levied to Parachains for management of
            voting, moving staking tokens between Parachains
            * **Governance Structure** for movement in correct
            direction with mechanism to deliver stability in
            real world (i.e. like existing political structure,
            bi-cameral/multi-role with referendum mechanism built-in
            so stakeholders have final say)
            * No other functionality (not accept any external transactions,
            does not host smart contracts)

        * **Parachains**
            * Parachains are governed by Validation functions
            but their Finality is determined by **Relay-Chain**
            (give up their minor sovereignty of determining their own **Finality**
            for increased ability to gether and process transactions)
            * Retain sovereignty of determining their own **Validity**

    * **Polkadot Consensus** (forming)
        * Relay-Chain Proof-of-Stake System
            * Guarantees shared canonicality o Parachains
            * Structured state machine performing several
            BFT Consensus' in parallel such that as the
            state machine progresses it converges on a solution
            but solution is not just a single block (from
            many valid candidates) since
            validity of candidate blocks occurs over multiple dimensions,
            where each Parachain is a dimension, so the
            validity of candidates is
            determined by Validity and Availability of transactions
            being processed on a Parachain that all the Validators
            vote upon using particular **Rules** mentioned in the
            Polkadot Paper of turning votes into alternate Consensus)
        * Structured State Machine
            * In R&D not yet finalised (PBFT-derivative likely)
                * **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance
        * Parallel Validation Groups
            * Validation and Consensus-forming canonicalisation
            is partitioned to allow scaling and
            occur in Parallel and at end they all sign-off on Final
            amalgum of the Parachain State Transitions
        * Approval Voting System Group for Nominators and Validators
            * Approval voting system for Nominators and Validators
                * i.e. Validators may say will vote for themself
                * i.e. Nominators may say they will vote for x, y, z Validators
            * Group Membership requires input of staking tokens to
            bond into the group
                * Removal from group takes 3 months since is timeframe where
                may still perform malicious actions on the network
                (short- and long-range attacks)
        * Approval Voting
            * Vote/Nominate for single or multiple Validators deemed acceptable
        * Constraint Optimiser
            * Configuration of Validators/Nominators for best fitting
            together using Maximum Lowest-Bonded, Minimum Total Inflation
            so everyone votes for someone else they actually approve of
            so choose the one with the most votes
        * Adaptive Rewards and Desired Level of Security
            * Rewards alter to target % of capital bonded
                * Set target % that we want to be bonded, for instance
                want 50% of staking capital in the system
                to be utilised (bonded)
                * Target reflects the security guarantees of the system
                * Target could be potentially removed from Validators upon
                misbehaviour (i.e. voting together for something bad/invalid)
            * Set Target for what Bonds we want to reach
            * Increasing/Decreasing Inflation through a market mechanism
            through the Approval Voting and the Contraint Optimiser to
            ensure have desired level of security (dynamical system with
            governance to determine values that make it work)
            * Bonds are used to pay for anything that could be broken

    * **Relaying Transactions**
        * Peer-to-peer
            * Ensure outgoing transactions from a Parachain reach their destination
            * Validators and Collators self-organise to arrange delivery of data

            * Logistics of Delivering Data
                * Obtain data from Parachain wishing to send messages
                * Transfer message data to destination Parachain bound for
                using Network Protocol ensuring Destination Validators (for
                the next block) can connect to the Source Validators (for the
                previous block) and arrange the transfer,
                where the Consensus Mechanism can only go from
                previous block to the next block if the Destination Validators
                agree they have all info they need
                (i.e. both Available and Valid) to enact Incoming messages

        * Tries and Proofs
            * Ensure **trust-free** transactions whereby
            organiser of Relaying transactions behaves accurately
            and do not arbitrarily drop or include new (i.e. their own)
            transactions (bad since destination would believe it happened in source chain
            when it did not)

            * Tries used to encode Ingress/Egress queues, allowing
            compact **Proofs of Misbehaviour**

        * Merkel Trees
            * Allow us to state that Leaf X is part of Tree if root is Y
            * Validators must agree on the root
                * If Validator agrees on Invalid root,
                we can prove it if we calculate that Input plus block
                transitions equal these Output roots, but does not
                agree with what they voted on
                * Punish Validators that agree on some eventual delivery
                that is deemed invalid, but does not deliver the data
            * State transition that happens with full knowledge of different
            Parachains at a point in the Consensus Process

    * **Polkadot Diagram**

            * Parachains
                * shown on each of 7x sides with posted transactions (messages)

            * Maintainers
                * Validators is triangles
                    * Police the system, deployed often to different
                    Parachains, Verify/sign-off witness statement
                    that system parts are ok and transactions valid,
                    Finalise Parachain PoV candidates into blocks
                    * Not specific to any Parachain, they float around,
                    are instructed as to what Parachain to Validate
                    at a time, randomly assigned changing every 1, 10, or 16
                    blocks
                    * aka Light-Client mechanisms built into Validation Function
                    that is part of the Relay Chain
                    (with no synchronisation with any Parachain),
                    that take PoV blocks, verify they are correct
                    (in legacy blockchain terminology)
                        * Note: When adding a Parachain you add a
                        Validation Function (like a Lite-Client mechanism for
                        the Parachain allowing Validators to take the PoV block
                        candidate and confirm as Yes valid or No invalid and throw out
                    * **Incentive** Rewarded for work without cheating

                * Nominators (similar to Miners)
                    * Passively oversee Validators and fund sound Validators with
                    staking tokens
                    * **Incentive** Rewarded for work without cheating
                * Blocks Properties to be Valid in Parachains
                    * Note: Parachain blocks may only become canonical
                    when the transactions are Available to any of the Validators
                    (whose job it is to ensure the data/transactions is available)

                    * Availability and Punishments
                        * Validators must confirm that External block data/transactions
                        are Available as part of Consensus Mechanism
                        * Collators must report to Validators if data/transactions
                        associated with External block is Not Available or nonsense
                        * Ensuring Availability is difficult since data is split
                        between many (i.e. 150) different closely bonded
                        Validators (Stakeholders/Actors) that interact with each other
                        and sign-off on Availability of data guarantees for Consensus.
                            * Forcing all to have all data it does not scale
                            * Individually handing out data makes hard to check
                            if any behaving maliciously (invalid data or
                            not having data so not able to reproduce it)
                        Instead we rely on Collators (since may be many and do not need
                        interact with each other), but we do not want to bond Collators,
                        so Collators need ability to police the Availability of data
                        on their Parachain, and count on them even if they're not paid well

                        * **Proof-of-Collator** where registered collators can challege data
                        availability

                        * i.e. Validators assigned to a specific Parachain,
                        which has important Incoming transactions (external data)
                        to compute block of Parachain (i.e. classic Ethereum/Bitcoin, etc)
                        so must be Available, and Validators agree to make it Available,
                        but unfortunately not all Validators, only a few (otherwise all need data and
                        not easily scalable).
                        Blockchains are deterministic so need all Inputs to process into all Outputs
                        But since have many Collators for block who may obtain data,
                        and set of Collators easily identifiable if any blocks signed with
                        their address in the past on the Parachain.
                        If Collator says they can't get data to sync a chain,
                        we identify them by their address as Collator,
                        Validator then investigates with another Validator (that they are assigned
                        every block to complain to), who is bound to check if they may obtain
                        data from other Validator that promised to make it Available.
                        If cannot get data, they initiate a Tribunal resulting in
                        **Mild Punishment** of Validator having its bond struck or just reduce its rewards, and if
                        repeat occurence of **Complaints** from different parts of system
                        their bonds are reduced substantially more, since different Validators
                        assigned each time (if it eventually provides data we do not know if bad validator or just
                         bad network connection).
                         **Mass Punishment** (entire bond removal) if never provide data
                          (i.e. forgot or never had data)

                        * Fairness
                            * Control Collator Set
                                * Golden Ticket (**Mild Reward**)
                                    * Incentive for Validators to prefer Collators
                                    with address close to magic ticket.
                                    This approaches **Proof of Work** without
                                    waste of power

                                    * 1:05:50 ????? Preserves bandwidth, avoiding Validators
                                    having to include **Proof of Validity** with
                                    every block, which reduces risk of **Sybil attack**
                                    (reputation subverted by forging identities in p2p network)
                                    of someone hosting 1000's of nodes trying to wash
                                    away good Validators and Collators

                                    * Golden Ticket is a Polkadot address
                                    in every block for each Parachain, and
                                    every Collator has a Polkadot address
                                    which denotes what Validator/Collator will be treated
                                    above all with a shared Reward

                                    (so when Validators come with PoV candidate blocks
                                    fed by Collators that are checked as Valid
                                    then the one signed by a Collator
                                    with block with closest address
                                    to ticket wins
                                * Avoids Collators challenging Validators
                                but ensuring a few Collators from last 3000 blocks
                                were behaving correctly
                                (i.e. want to find data and complain if cannot find data)


                    * Validity
                        * Voted on to ensure External data/transactions are real
                        (to prevent instances where block is Finalised, but
                        where its data/transactions are Not Available, then
                        cannot Verify the block in the future, and the
                        State Transition is Invalid too, since its Input data
                        is nonsense).

                     **Proof of Validity (PoV)** candidate blocks (with all info of
                    Parachain made available),
                    show results of executing blocks, then sufficiently prove
                    to the Validator that transactions are Valid and
                    have Executed Correctly when providing
                    **PoV** for block (and wait to see if their ticket wins).
                    If their ticket wins and goes in, any transaction fees they collected
                    from creating the PoV candidate block will be paid to them
                    when the PoV candidate blocks become canonical/Finalised

                    (which is the only way they obtain transaction fees).
                    This is similar to if Miners on legacy blockchain like Bitcoin or
                    Ethereum produced solution but did not include transactions as part
                    of the block, it would be rejected (both by software, and because
                    without transactions we are unable to change the state to what its meant
                    to be, so may built a block ontop of that block)
                    * aka Full-nodes sitting on the Parachain
                    (in legacy blockchain terminology)
                    * **Incentive** is Parachain transaction fees for creating PoV
                    candidate blocks
                * Fisherman
                    * Monitor/discover network transactions for
                    bad behaviour
                    * **Incentive** is proportion of bond of the
                    Validator they take to tribunal and demonstrate
                    behaved badly
        * Parachain Bridge (fake Parachain)
            * Prevents Parachains from just being a Stubs
            by **pretending** to be a Parachain with transactions,
            incoming messages and validatable.
            * Other side of Parachain Bridge is Other
            Blockchain Network
            * **Issue with Parachain Bridges is potential Double-Spend** is they
             do not share Finality (i.e. do not share the Consensus mechanism)
                * Example of Issue:
                    * If Relay Chain comes to Final decision that
                    blocks from Other Blockchain Network are Valid,
                    labels the transaction as canonical and will not be
                    rolled back so allows transaction to transition into the
                    next Blockchain Network, but then the Other Blockchain Network
                    on other side of Parachain Bridge they say no it
                    was not Final and they will go another direction.
                * Solution:
                    * Allow external side-effects to proceed with some security
                    by wait say 1000 blocks (i.e. 1 hr to 1 day) and if not reverted label
                    it as fine (what Decentralised Exchanges DEX do)
            * Validation Function checks that blocks from
            Other Blockchain Network are actually Valid

        * Second-Order Relay Chain
            * In 2nd phase of Polkadot Protocol R&D scalability
            * Appears like a Parachain but works like a
            Relay-Chain (with its own Parachains on its sides)


        * Closed vs Open Parachains

            * Open Parachains
                * Previously discussed mechanisms ensuring security of Open Parachains

            * Closed Parachains
                * Same as Open Parachain Mechanism toward overarching Finalisation
                and Consensus Mechanism
                * BUT DO NOT allow PoV to execute transactions and ensuring they end up
                at expected result as part of Validation Function
                * INSTEAD whilst Validation Function still Validates,
                it uses Mechanism of only checking that a transactions signatories are valid
                and signed-off by set of Authorities and that message is being delivered
                (i.e. Stakeholders from other chain or consortium of named Authorities),
                it opens opportunity to Encrypting the contents of the State, since no
                longer need to know the State, Inputs, Outputs
                (since no longer executing transactions)
                * Allows inclusion of Consortiums, Private Chains, and Internal Chains into
                the Polkadot Community able to interact with Public and Open Chains
                * Allows **trust-less** services to get on Public and Open Chains

        * Bridge Chains (opposite diagonal of matrix)

            * Retain the Validation portion, has PoV block to check the transaction works properly
            * BUT IGNORES the canonicalisation
            * Useful for:
                * Incorporating existing Legacy Chains into Polkadot Community of Parachains
                * Extensible Parachains (where insufficient freedom within Standard Parachain
                Validity Function Architecture) offering additional freedoms in terms of
                Technical Development made possible if allowed their own
                canonicalisation mechanism

    * Questions
        * In relation to Constraint Optimiser, what does
        Maximum Lowest-Bonded, Minimum Total Inflation mean?
        * Are Collators given rewards (from the transaction fees for
        creating PoV candidate blocks that are Valid and Available)
        even if tickets submitted to Validators
        are not winners (i.e. do not become canonical/Finalised)?
        * What is meant by Tries used to encode Ingress/Egress queues, allowing
        compact **Proofs of Misbehaviour**?
        * What is **Proof-of-Collator** where registered collators can challege data
        availability?
