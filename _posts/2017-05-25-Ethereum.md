                    ```
                    brew tap ethereum/ethereum

                    A valid GOPATH is required to use the `go get` command.
                    If $GOPATH is not specified, $HOME/go will be used by default:
                      https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

                    You may wish to add the GOROOT-based install location to your PATH:
                      export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin

                    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
                    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
                    state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

                    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
                    do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

                      git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

        * GitHub https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-plugin
        * About
            * Allows ordinary websites talk to trusted
            Ethereum provider, whilst allowing user to
            store and manage their own private keys,
            to allow people to start creating new wave
            of blockchain-enabled websites
        * Metamask is Chrome Extension to turn it
        into a Ethereum blockchain-connected browser by injecting
        Ethereum web3 JavaScript API into every website's
        javascript context, so that DAPPS
        can read from the blockchain.
        MetaMask also lets the user create and manage
        their own identities, so when a Dapp wants to
        perform a transaction and write to the
        blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to
        securely manage identities or
        review the transactions, before approving or
        rejecting it
        * Install from metamask.io
            * Setup
                * Create Vault
                * Safely store Seed Phrase
                (incase need to restore all accounts
                in any browser)
                * Switch or Add more accounts
                * Account Vault is encrypted and locally
                stored in browser (no account info touches
                servers)
                * Encrypt a New Den
                * Switch to Main Network (instead of Test website)
                * Reload the webpage so it loads
            * Capabilities
                * Send Ether like normal Wallet app
                * Enables browser to visit Ethereum-enabled
                websites
                * If you say want to submit a form
                to sign up to Ethlance, you will be submitting
                form metadata to associate with your
                Ethereum Address when operation completes, but first
                it's important to proof read before click
                "Send" since it will cause
                DAPP to write to blockchain,
                it asks Ethereum web3 JavaScript API to
                send the transaction, prompting Metamask
                DAPP to ask for user confirmation
                (i.e. "Accept" or "Reject"), since whenever
                write to Ethereum blockchain you pay a small
                Ether fee (see Fees section) to the Ethereum network,
                after submit transaction and click "Accept"
                wait for Ethereum blockchain to apply its
                next block for the change to be reflected on
                website
                * Metamask connects to blockchains with
                no syncronisation time since we host
                blockchain nodes by default
                (alternatively can point Metamask at own
                "Custom Network"
                Ethereum RPC Server for full control
                of your connection to the blockchain
                * Choose what Network to work on
                    * Main Ethereum Network
                    (i.e. issue token with full security
                    of Ethereum blockchain)
                    * Morden Test Network
        * Add Funds to Ethereum Address
            * **IMPORTANT NOTES**
                * Bitcoin and Ethereun are different networks
                and not cross-compatible
                (i.e. Ether does not exist on Bitcoin network
                and vice versa)
                * Ethereum addresses are 42 characters long,
                and usually start with a "0x".
                * Bitcoin addresses are usually shorter that Ethereum.
                * Always ensure ask person person with whom you are
                transacting what type of address they are providing
            * Use ShapeShift https://info.shapeshift.io/about
            to identify amount of
            X to send to Y Address
            (where X and Y are different cryptocurrencies),
            then login to CoinJar.com.au and transfer Bitcoin to
            the address provided by ShapeShift. Once that payment is
            transferred they perform the transfer of X to Y

        * Fees
            * Ethereum Gas Fees every time change something in the
            Ethlance database asked to pay a small fee
            (usually a couple of cents) called "gas fees"
            to compensate for the electricity costs of the computers
            running the Ethereum blockchain, which is why
            Ethlance not need rent servers and keeps service fees as
            low as 0%! This fee is a great protection against spam.
            * **Max Transaction Fee**
                * Maximum amount, always **Oversupply** amount of Ether
                you will use so always have enough for Operation,
                and extra unspent contingency Ether will be
                returned back.
                (since incase operation executed but
                did not have enough Ether to execute, then would have
                spent all Ether but operation wouldn't have finished
                i.e. wasted your Ether).
        * Tech Understanding
            * Understanding usage of native cryptographic tokens,
            like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based
            tokens that follow the Ethereum Token Standard
            (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20), and
            blockchain-based software systems

            Build Trading Newsletter Fund

            Website landing page with crypto managed fund theme (for crypto noobs, but pro legacy investors) and login to view full monthly newsletter about crypto trading. JS/CSS/HTML preferred and as much run from github, ETH, IPFS as possible.  Fully Mobile compatible
            1. https://github.com/ScythianFund/scythian.github.io
            2. U2F login/account authentication that Trezor option.

            Dynamic graphical charts our crypto investment fund.
            Integration of highcharts and/or cyber.fund portfolio at
            Available source code for https://github.com/cyberFund and good list of all available source to contribute as we expand the use of Ethereum wallet, token, contracts.
            Our current example portfolio at https://cyber.fund/@Scythian_Fund   We can prove ownership of keys to majority of holdings not on exchanges.

            Integrated Ethereum ECR20 wallet that recognizes a created token by default and relates value to our total fund value / number of tokens they hold. This wallet should work with Trezor so maybe a custom myethereumwallet.com fork that has the default page as simple as possible and then ‚Äúadvance user‚Äù opens up all other available options.
            ECR20 creation, 4 character symbol and 8 decimals.
            Mobile ethereum wallets on IOS and Android, although not as important if our web wallet runs well on devices.
