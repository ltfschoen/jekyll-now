    * Is a fully distributed peer-to-peer software network
    * Uses cryptography to securely host apps and store data
    * Able to transfer digital representation of real-world money
  * How
    * Uses cryptography to secure a single computing environment
    from multiple machines without a central authority or owner
* Cryptography Dfn
  * What
    * Communication via encoded messages
* Ethereum Dfn
  * What
    * Protocol - Ethereum Protocol is an extension derived from Bitcoin that is a Turing-complete data structure with the ability to save state (a stateful system that detects and remembers information changes over time)
    * Network - Ethereum "peer-to-peer" Network of computers using the Protocol that are connected to each other running the same software
    * Project - Ethereum Funding source
    * Distributed Apps (Dapps) - applications built with Ethereum kit
    * Cryptoeconomics - System of incentives and disincentives that secure the Ethereum Network
  * How
    * Custom Decentralised Economic Systems - Build custom decentralised economic systems that include:
      * Account management
      * Currency unit of exchange (aka Coins/Tokens/Cryptocurrencies) that are only usable within the system
    * Web browser access to Ethereum Network
      * Use software libraries like Web3.js to connect an applications front-end (browser GUI) to its back-end Ethereum Network blockchain via JavaScript APIs
    * Custom Financial Contracts (aka Smart Contracts)
      * Write financial contracts with other Ethereum users using the Solidity programming language
