* Parity Client
    * Goal
        * Fast, lightweight, secure Ethereum network client
    * Features
        * Ethereum account management
            * Create and Manage Account
            * Manage Ether and Ethereum tokens
            * Create and Register Custom tokens
    * Parity Light-Client Node - almost finished
        * Send/receive, get info, network interaction
    * Parity Light-Client Wallet - work required
        * Connects to Geth node from Ethereum wallet with `parity --geth`
        * Check address balance: https://etherscan.io/
        * Questions - is it possible to point Parity to and
        sync Ethereum folder where full blockchain downloaded
        previously with mist?
        * Integrates in web browser
    * Parity Light-Client Wallet Mobile App - internal testing
        * Interacts with Parity Node

* Kovan - Stable Ethereum Public Testnet
    * About:
        * Parity's Proof of Authority (PoA) Consensus Engine
        * Reliable infrastructure to aid development of Ethereum Dapps (replaces Ropsten, Morden)
        * Requires Parity PoA Protocol
        * Requires Parity >1.5.7
        * Kovan Ether acquirable using Faucet Guide
    * Benefits (over Ropsten):
        * Spam attack immunity (Ether supply controlled by trusted parties)
        * Consistent block time (4 sec) to minimise transaction confirmation latency
        * Parallel transaction processing of transactions 3-6x improvement (EIP-98)
        * Supports Parity secure blockchain-based auto-update system
    * Config
        * macOS Interact with Kovan Chain `parity --chain=kovan`
        * Network stats https://stats.kovan.network/

    * Reason
        * https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal/blob/master/Press%20Release.md

* Product Management
    * Unit tested 100%
    * Public APIs 100% documented
