        * Particle Photon (only programmable in C++)
         Microcontroller by Particle.io https://community.particle.io/t/running-python-on-the-particle-photon/12636
         (previously by Spark.io) is like
         Arduino (but with built-in Wifi) that has
         castellated pads for soldering onto a PCB
         and is breadboard-friendly
         with Wifi chip (Broadcom Wiced) paired with
         ARM Cortex-M3 (STM32F3) processor
         and powerable by microUSB
         that supports secure connections with SSL
         to prevent hacking of this IoT device
         that is programmable using Arduino-like
         programming language using cloud-based IDE with
         ability to download compiled code over Wifi to
         its Particle Core. The Particle Photon microcontroller
        is a modular "Arduino Shield" (i.e. Shield-shaped)
        circuit board that may be inserted (piggybacked)
        onto a "Particle Shield Shield" product https://www.adafruit.com/product/2725,
        to provide extra functionality. The "Particle Shield Shield"
        converts the pin mapping of the "Particle Photon"
        into the Arduino pin layout, which
        allows for use of existing Arduino shields and accessories
        (i.e. data logging). Note: Some Arduino libraries only work after being
        ported over

    * Choose Microcontroller,i.e.
        * Teensy 3.x for sound processing and hardware hacking
        * ESP8266 has built in wifi capabilities
