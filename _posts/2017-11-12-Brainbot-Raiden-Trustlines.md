        * About
            * In PoW each peer maintains copy of program state (RSM),
            a state-transition function, and output function.
            * Peers receive inputs from Clients, execute agreement
            protocol to determine next state-transition
            * Blockchain holds multiple input streams, so challenge
            to ensure RSMs only consume inputs meant for them
            * DApps built using blockchain as "input stream" benefits:
              * Independent bootstrapping global state by RSM peers
              * Open-membership apps - only valid shared truth
                inputs accepted
              * App continuity - If all peers go offline, can still
              boot up own using the blockchain and continue where others
              left off
              * Consensus Hash (partition set of all running RSMs
              into **Fork Sets**) to reach consensus whilst remaining
              off-chain, so blockchain not need aware of apps

      * PyEthApp Console uses **Kademlia Routing** https://github.com/ethereum/pyethapp/wiki/The_Console
    * Interest **Networking & Concurrency** (important)
      * `gevent` Coroutine-based Python Concurrency networking library
      (flow control cooperatively passed b/w two different routines without returning)
      i.e. `yield` creates co-routine so when encountered the current
      State of function is Saved and control returned to calling function.
      Calling function can transfer execution back to yielding function
      and restore state and continue.

    * **Micro Raiden**
      * About -
        * Problem - Ethereum facing problem supporting current user-base
        and requiring unimaginable amount
        of data being put on blockchain in order to grow to scale
        sufficient to replace Google and Facebook, whereby every node
        has to download the shared ledger
        * Solution - Solve scaling puzzle by allowing more transactions
        that will be cheaper. Micro Raiden designed as many-to-one
        payment channels that are ERC-20 standard compatible
        (supporting tokens launched on Ethereum)
        for DApp developers (one service provider
        offering services to many recurring customers).
        Allows users to make
        **direct** micropayments channels between each other
        (in single direction) without requiring the full-network,
        instead of routing payments through network of nodes
      * Link: https://www.coindesk.com/raiden-release-simpler-micropayments-go-live-ethereums-testnet/
    * **Raiden Network**
      * About - Open-source protocol and reference implementation of
      decentralised system that enables scalable, low latency, low cost
      transfers of ERC20 tokens.
      Increases number of transactions supported by blockchains per block
      to become fit for global adoption of blockchain payments and
      tokenisation.
        * Raiden Network is to provide backbone of global token transfers by
        scaling token transfer capacity by using network of
        off-chain state channels to securely transfer any ERC20 token.
        * Raiden (RDN) token to be default currency for transactions
        between services and clients on the Raiden Network.
        * RDN cryptocurrency is the means of representing and
        exchanging value on Raiden Network
        * RDN token is payoff in incentive mechanism and punishment (bribing)
        system (**Game Theory**) for actors (i.e. miners) to encourage broader
        community to validate good behaviour. It provides crypto-economically
        secure systems through requiring
        6x confirmations to validate transaction security
        to adopt its protocol and verify transactions.
           * Malicious Attack Types
             * P + e - Attacker bribes all players so they agreed on false answers
             with P (normal payoff) + e (bribe) and attacker pays nothing
             * 51% - Single attacker contributes majority of network mining
             hash rate to obtain full control and manipulate blockchain
        * RDN token **crypto-economics** is the cryptographic technology
        (cryptography) applied to economics through the analysis of
        economic incentives to support the token

    * **Trustlines**
      * 5x Developers
      * About -
        * Problem - money on blockchain is mined and average users can
        only buy with fiat money, requiring bank account and
        centralised exchanges, but truly decentralised economic infrastructure
        should be independent of traditional financial infrastructure
        * Solution -
        People powered money movement.
        Defining decentralised money as IOUs based on individual trust
        relationships to provide fair access to money via friendships.
        Payments routed along path of trusting peers on social graph,
        allowing anyone to join Ethereum without having to acquire ETH with
        fiat money
        Permissionless mobile payments (i.e. bill splitting).
        Global payment based on individual trust relationships.
        Trustlines (creditlines) established between people you trust,
        allowing an amount of spending.
      * Demo
        * Web app that uses Trustline Smart Contract that creates an agreement between two people who can create bilateral creditlines balance with each other to track how much they owe each other. The Web App uses a RESTful API to communicate with smart contracts on the blockchain via a Relay Server.
        * Relay Server (Off-Chain) acts as pathfinding helper that finds path of trusting users between payer and payee in order to relay transactions from a mobile phone to the blockchain efficiently
      * Releases
        * Draft Whitepaper - http://trustlines.network/whitepaper.html
        * "Sputnik" Proof of Concept (June 2017)

        * Beta release due Nov 2017
          * Including complex Smart Contracts, Android and iPhone apps and scalable Relay Server
    * **RaidEX** Raiden Network MVP (https://www.raidex.io/)
      * About -
        * Problem - Existing blockchain-based decentralised exchanges (DEX)
        are slow (inherit performance restrictions of global consensus
        systems incl. latency and limited transaction throughput that
        results in low liquidity for exchanges), not scale, high fees,
        so not ready for real-world usage
        * Solution - RaidEX project solves using off-chain
        State Channel tech (Raiden Network)
        allowing fast DEX without central entity, setting new standards
        for secure, transparent, and performant DEX to restore trust
        in crypto DEXs.

      * About
        * PyEthApp - https://github.com/ethereum/pyethapp
        * Ethereum Protocol Core Dev Python (**PyEthereum** on Github)
        * **Hydrachain DApp** - Private chain extension of Ethereum platform
        that adds permissioning and supports creating scalable blockchain apps
        compliant with organisation and regulatory requirements.
          * **Account Validators** - Coordinates transactions with
          Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol that is not
          dependent on PoW, but instead relies on registered/accountable set of
          validators (propose and validate order of transactions)
            * Reference: https://github.com/HydraChain/hydrachain/blob/master/hc_consensus_explained.md
            * BFT - defend against Byzantine failures, in which components
            system fail with symptoms that prevent some components from
            reaching agreement among themselves, where such agreement is
            needed for the correct operation of the system
          * **Scalability** - Sharding supported so Nodes can manage multiple
          linked chains in same process. Unlimited asset transfer capacity
          provided by framework for trust free off-chain transactions
          * **Instant Finality** - New blocks negotiated by validators who
          collectively agree to sign off for a block prior to adding to blockchain.
          No forks or reverts to state. Protocol provides sub-second block times.
          * **Proof of Identity** (KYC/AML)
            * Add-on ensures all transactions in system are b/w registered
            participants only. Provides auditibility. Preserves privacy.
          * **Native Contracts**
            * Add-on to develop smart contracts in Python and natively executed.
            Provides faster execution speed, reduced development times,
            improved debugging.
            Native Contracts are interoperatble with EVM-based contracts written
            in Solidity or Serpent and may co-exist on same chain
* Consensus Algorithm Categories
  * **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** - in "public" blockchains it is the
  chance of being paid new coins is determined by mining power,
  which is greater the more coins you held (validators economic
  stake in the network). Tokens must be
  locked up to count toward mining power.
  **Security** increases with more miners doing this, it reduces risk
  of centralisation, and it increases energy efficiency
  (by avoiding computational waste by requiring prover to show
  ownership of coins
  * **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** - mining power
  based on amount of CPU/GPU power you have
